    <div class="pchb_greeting">Greetings PCHB!</div>

    <div class="pchb">Today we launch Coffee Talk, a computer application that simulates picking a name out of a hat.
      This
      is a new bureau initiative brought to you by the Bureau Development Work Group and a fun way to get to know your
      bureau colleagues. Many of us don’t see each other on a day-to-day basis since we’re located in different areas of
      NM. We hope this brings staff in the bureau closer together. We believe that the more we get to know each other,
      the
      easier it is to reach out and work together.
    </div>


    <div class="left-menu">
      Here’s how it works:
      <ul>
        <li> When you enter the site, you’ll be able to push a button and a random bureau colleague’s name will be
          “magically” revealed to you.
        </li>

        <li> You then call or email that person and find a time to have a conversation to get to know one another. This
          is
          considered work time and you can meet face-to-face, via skype, have a phone conversation, take a walk, get a
          cup
          of coffee, etc.! You decide. You can talk about anything you like. If you’re unsure how to get the
          conversation
          started, you’ll also receive a fun question that may help you get going. You choose whether you want to use
          that
          question or not.
        </li>

        <li> You’ll have an opportunity to talk with one of your bureau colleagues twice each quarter, once as an
          initiator and once as a recipient when someone else gets your name. The list of names will get refreshed
          (re-randomized) every quarter, and everyone can pick again!
        </li>

        <li> Have fun with it!
        </li>

      </ul>
